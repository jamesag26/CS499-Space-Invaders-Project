# CS499-Space-Invaders-Project
Project for Software Engineering for Senior Project class

The goal of this project was to recreate the Space Invaders game as a web application with the hopes you getting it playable on a chromecast device. My responsibility for this project was focused on creating the web application with another partner while our other partners focused on creating the Android application which would act as the controller to while playing on the Chromecast device. The code for the web application of space invaders along with the necessary files to play the game locally on your machine without connecting to a Chromecast device are located in this project folder.
